## Requirements

I've used NodeJS v13 to develop this project but I've tested earlier versions until NodeJS v10 and they all worked fine.

## Installation

Although the code is shipped with the modules I've installed at the moment you can delete the `node_modules` folder and install everything from scratch using `npm install`, if you wish so.

## Usage

In order to run the unit tests you need to use the following command: `npm run test`

To run the actual program you should use `./fizzbuzz <start_number> <end_number>` 


## Notes

- I've tried to make the code as much readable as possible which sometimes has some minimal drawbacks in terms of performance
- I've also tried to test multiple scenarios for the unit tests
- The choosen technology is purely based on my background experience
